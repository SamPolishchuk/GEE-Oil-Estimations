Current Pipeline:
1. Overpass API for Tank Polygons
2. Upload to GEE for FEature Collection
3. GEE Sentinel-2 for Weekly images and sun relative position
4. GEE feature engineering (shadow/texture)
5. GEE reduce regions and export csv (tank-week table)

To do:
6. Produce estimates of oil in each tank
7. Produce trade signals for buy or sell oil before EIA inventory data
8. Pair with sentiment data and oil shipment data for improved estimates
